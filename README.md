# public-pitching-dashboard

This project creates a dashboard of pitching data to be used by coaches, players, and their parents to track progress and performance.

Initially, it will store and provide visualizations of pitch data imported from PitchLogic, Rapsodo, and Trackman. Other data sources and video may be in the future.
